== Create a Stateful Application
In this lab you will deploy an existing application that requires a database. You will also start up a database instance via an available installed database operator.

=== Create a project in OpenShift
This section describes how to create the CodeReady Workspaces project in OpenShift web console.

. Login as developer user to Developer Console
. Navigate to the top and click onto the project name image:dev-project[dev project]
. Click the `Create Project` button.
. Enter the project details:
.. In the *Name* field, type `statefulapp-<Username>`.
.. In the *Display Name* field, type `Stateful App Example`.
. Click the `Create` button.

=== Create Database instance

. In the left panel, navigate to the *Topology*.
. Click onto `From Catalog` tile.
. Click `CockroachDB` tile.
. Click `Create`.
. Update `Replicas: 3` to `Replicas: 1` in the YAML.
. Update the memory to 500Mi and Storage 1Gi
+
[source, yaml]
----
  Resources:
    requests:
      cpu: 100m
      memory: 500Mi
  InitPodResources: {}
  Storage: 1Gi
----
. Click `Create`.
. Under the `Topology`, Wait for the database instance start up completely as shown here image:database-ready.png[database instance]
. Click onto the middle of the icon as shown here image:topology-db-view.png[db details]
. You can see the summary of all the resources were being created.
. The status of the pod is in `Running` means the database is ready to use.
. Also note the service name with `-public`. In this example the public service name is `example-cockroachdb-public`

=== Accessing the database instance and create table for the application

.  In the left panel, navigate to the *More â†’ Search*.
. Click 'Resources' dropdown.
. Type `cockroachdb` in the `search resource` textbox.
. Click onto `Cockroachdb` from the list.
. Click `example` or the one custom resource that listed.
. Copy the command to create a client pod to access the database instance image:dbclient-cli.png[db client]
. Go to a terminal, login as the developer user
+
[source,shell]
----
$ oc login -u <dev-username> {{API_URL}}
----
. Switch context to the `statefulapp-<Username>` project
+
[source,shell]
----
$ oc project <dev-username>
----
. Let's spin up the database client as a pod by paste the command that you get from the custom resource
+
[source,shell]
----
$ kubectl run -it --rm cockroach-client \
--image=cockroachdb/cockroach \
--restart=Never \
--command -- \
./cockroach sql --insecure --host=example-cockroachdb-public.statefulapp-user1
----
. You will get the similar prompt after executing the command above.
+
[source,shell]
----
If you don't see a command prompt, try pressing enter.
'root@example-cockroachdb-public.statefulapp-user1:26257/defaultdb>
----
. you are now in the client pod, let's create the database table here using the following commands.
+
[source,shell]
----
CREATE USER myuser;
CREATE DATABASE customers;
GRANT ALL ON DATABASE customers TO myuser;
exit;
----

=== Deploy Application via Developer console

. Fork the example Spring Boot Github repo from https://github.com/piggyvenus/springboot-cockroach
. Login as developer user to Developer Console
. In the left panel, navigate to the *+Add*.
. Click `From Git` tile.
. Enter the Enter the Git URL from your forked repo
. Select `8` under `Builder Image Version`
. Enter 'stateful-front' as `Application Name` and `Name` under General section.
. Click `Create`.

=== Update database service name and build

. Go to the git repo and update `spring.datasource.url` in the file `src/main/resources/application.properties` as shown below
+
[source,shell]
----
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://example-cockroachdb-public:26257/customers?sslmode=disable
----
. Make sure your database service name replace `example-cockroachdb-public` to the one matches your deployment.
. Commit changes
. Go to Developer console
. In the left panel, navigate to the *Topology*
. Click in the middle of the `stateful-front` icon and details will shows on the right.
. Click `view logs` from the Builds as shown here image:view-logs.png[view build log]
. Click `Action` --> cancel build
. In the left panel, navigate to the *Build*
. Click 3-dot icon on the right and select `Start Build`

=== Test the application

. In the left panel, navigate to the *Topology*
. Click in the middle of the `stateful-front` icon and details will shows on the right.
. You can see both pods are in `Running` state since they show as a solid blue circle around the pods.
. Click onto the link under Route section in the right panel image:statefullapp.png[running]
. Add `/init` to the url from the browser to initialize the database table.
. Change the URL to `/customer` to view the data from the database table.


=== Import Source code to CodeReady Workspace
If you like to import the code into code ready, here are the steps.


. Fork the example Spring Boot Github repo from https://github.com/piggyvenus/springboot-cockroach
. Click the ApplicationMenu on the top right corner image:application-menu.png[Application Menu]
. Click `CodeReady workspaces`
. In the left panel, navigate to the *Workspaces* image:workspaces.png[workspaces]
. Click `Add Workspace`
. Update the name as `statefulapp`
. Select `Java Spring Boot` from `Select Stack`
. Click `Remove` from the `Projects` section image:workspace-proj.png[Remove sample project]
. Click `Git`
. Enter the Git URL from your forked repo
. Click `Add`
. Click `Create and Open`
