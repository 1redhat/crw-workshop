== Porting a plugin
In this workshop we will port an existing https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim[Visual Studio Code Vim] emulator extension to a {{ PRODUCT }} plugin and add it to a workspace via the `Devfile` configuration.

The following three secions will describe how to write the *schema meta* file wrapper for the plugin, how to incorporate teh Visual Studio Code extension, and how to add it to a workspace.

=== Creating the Plugin-in Wrapper
The CodeReady Workspaces API is compatible with Visual Studio Code. Plug-ins are isolated and provide their own dependencies packaged in containers and run as sidecars to the pod.

We'll start by creating a new public repository to store our plug-in source code and then define our plug-in meta data.

. Let's start by visiting the template repository on GitHub: `https://github.com/readyhat/che-plugin-blueprint[readyhat/che-plugin-blueprint]`. 
. Click the green button labeled **"Use this template"** near the **"Clone or Download"** button.
. Specify a **Repository name** and be sure the repository is set to **public**.
. Click to view the `meta.yaml` file source.
. Edit the `meta.yaml` file in GitHub by clicking the **pencil** button.

+
. There are two instances of each the following values that you will need to replace with your data: `publisherName`, `pluginName`, and `pluginVersion`. Make sure the `extensions` repository maps to the Git repository you're working in. Commit the chagnes to your `master` branch once complete.

[source, yaml]
----
apiVersion: v2
## Name of the publisher.
## Example: readyhat
publisher: publisherName
## Slugified version of the plug-in name.
## Example: vscode-vim

## For the sake of organization & simplicity
## match this to the version of the VS Code
## extension. Example: 1.14.1

=== The VS Code Extension

The Visual Studio Code Extension is a `.vsix` file that we will download from the Visual Studio marketplace and add to our repository.

. Visit the https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim[Vim extension] on the Visual Studio Code marketplace.
. Click the **"Download Extension"** link located in the right most column and save it to your local hard drive and rename the file to `vscode-vim.vsix`.
. Return to the root of your Git repository and click the **"Upload files"** button.
. Upload the `vscode-vim.vsix` file and commit it to your `master` branch.
. Now we will tag a release by clicking Now we will tag a release by clicking **"0 releases"** on our repository dashboard.
. Specify the version number that you provided for the `extensions` repository in the `meta.yaml` file (ex. v1.14.1) and click the green **"Publish release"** button.
. Lastly, copy the link to your tagged release of the `meta.yaml` file by navigating to **Version tag → meta.yaml** and then clicking the **"Raw"** button. Copy the URL from the address bar.

=== Installing the Plug-in
Now we'll install the ported plugin to your workspace.

. Select a workspace from your dashboard and navigate to the **"Devfile"** tab.
. Locate the `components:` and add a new component.
+
[source, yaml]
----
components:
  ...
  - type: chePlugin
    reference: {plugin-repository} (ex: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/readyhat/che-plugin-vim/v1.14.1/meta.yaml)
----
. Click **"Save"** and then click **"Run"** before opening the workspace.
. If you're able to use Vim commands then your plugin was successfully ported and installed!

NOTE: You can now find the Vim plug-in in the plug-in panel by navigating to **View → Plugins** and filtering by "Show Installed Plugins".
