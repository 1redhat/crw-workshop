== Working with Plugins

In this lab you will learn how to work with the plugins that ship with CodeReady Workspaces and how to port a VS Code plugin.

=== Plugin Library (Catalog?)
CodeReady Workspaces is deployed with a plugin registry of all the plugins that have already been ported to CodeReady Workspaces.

To browse the catalog of available plugins select *View â†’ Plugins* from the main menu.

To view the raw plugin registry visit `/v3/plugins/index.json`.
