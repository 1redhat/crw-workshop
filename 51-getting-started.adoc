== Getting Started with CodeReady Workspaces

In this lab we will walk through setting up or first workspace.


=== Create a workspace

We will be creating a Quarkus application.  If your experience with java this will all look familar.  If not don't worry the point of this excercise is to teach the value of CodeReady Workspaces and not a programming language.

. Within the page you will see a Quarkus tile, click it. Notice the tile in the image above.
. Notice in the upper right the *CREATE AND OPEN* button is highlighted, click it.
. This will start an ide and will take a few minutes. You will see updates as it progress and notice the workspace being created under the *RECENT WORKSPACES*.
. Once completed the IDE will open.  If you have worked with Visual Studio the IDE should look familar.  Both products are based on an opensource upstream project.
