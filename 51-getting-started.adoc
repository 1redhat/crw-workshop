== Getting Started with CodeReady Workspaces

In this lab we will walk through setting up or first workspace.


=== Create a workspace

We will be creating a Quarkus application.  If your experience with java this will all look familar.  If not don't worry the point of this excercise is to teach the value of CodeReady Workspaces and not a programming language.

. If your not already on the *Getting Started* view.  Click it on the left.

. Within the page you will see a *Quarkus Tools* tile, click it. Notice the tile in the image above.
. In the upper right the *CREATE AND OPEN* button is highlighted, click it.
. This IDE will start in a few minutes. You will see updates as it progresses and notice the workspace being created under the *RECENT WORKSPACES*.
. Once completed the IDE will open.  If you have worked with Visual Studio Code the IDE should look familar.  Both products are based on the same opensource upstream project.

=== Introduction to the file exployer and terminal 

. Click on the *files* icon which is on the top left. This will ope the file exployer.
. Expand the *quarkus-quickstarts* and *getting-started* folder notice the structure is similar to any other java maven project.
. Next lets look at the file system in the terminal. 
. Click *Terminal* in the menu bar.
. Click *Open Terminal in specific container*.
. Click the first container in the list named *maven* notice its label the developer container.
. in the terminal window.

[source,shell]

cd quarkus-quickstarts/getting-started/
ls -la

. Notice the file exployer and terminal are showing.
the same files.  This is the file system of you development environment.
. Below is a screen shot of what your environment should look like.

=== Tasks, hot deploy, and debugging

. On the far right click on the *cube* icon (task manager).
. Expand *User Runtimes* and *maven*.
. Single Click *Package the application*.
. Notice a new terminal window opens and *mvn package* is executed against the project.

. Now lets start the appllication.
. In the same list single click the *Start Quarkus in devmode (hot deploy + debug)*.
. A modal will open stating "A process is not listening...".

+
. Go back to the task manager on the right and click *hello-greeting-endpoint*
. Change *che-user* at the end of the url to your first name. Notice how the page responds once you hit enter.
. Now lets change some code. 
. Go to the GreetingService.java class shown below.
+

+
. Change hello to *hola* and save the file
. Refresh your browser from the previous step and notice the change was introduced without a compile step.  If you closed your browser window click *hello-greeting-endpoint* again.
. *Hot deploy* does not require you to recompile the code to execute code changes. Its one of many features in Quarkus.
. Now lets turn our attention to debuging.
. Notice in the menu bar a *Debug* item, click it.
+

+
. In the *GreetingService* add a break point by clicking in the gutter of the statement shown below.  You will end up with a red dot like below.
+

+
. Refresh you browser showing the *hello-greeting-endpoint* or click it again in the task manager
. Go back to the IDE and notice the break point has been hit.

. Notice all the debuggging panes on the left side of workspace.
. Clike the *blue play pause* button to continue executing the code.
