= Working with Plugins
In this lab you will learn how to work with plugins which are used to extend the native functionality of {{ PRODUCT }}.

There are are three ways to work with {{ PRODUCT }} plugins:
. *{{ PRODUCT }}* includes a plugin registry with a number of compatible plugins supported by Redhat.
. *Visual Studio Code Extensions* can be ported or "wrapped" and included in a workspace or added to an external registry.
. *External Registries* can augment the plugin library by centralizing a group of widely used business plugins.
