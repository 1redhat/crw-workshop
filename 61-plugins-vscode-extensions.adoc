== Porting a plugin
In this workshop we will port an existing https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim[Visual Studio Code Vim] emulator extension to a {{ PRODUCT }} plugin and add it to a workspace via the `Devfile` configuration.

The following three secions will describe how to write the *schema meta* file wrapper for the plugin, how to incorporate teh Visual Studio Code extension, and how to add it to a workspace.

=== Schema Meta File
The CodeReady Workspaces API is compatible with Visual Studio Code. Plug-ins are isolated and provide their own dependencies packaged in containers and run as sidecars to the pod.

We'll start by creating a new public repository to store our plug-in source code and then define our plug-in meta data.

. Let's start by visiting the template repository on GitHub: `https://github.com/readyhat/che-plugin-blueprint[readyhat/che-plugin-blueprint]`. 
. Click the green button labeled **"Use this template"** near the **"Clone or Download"** button.
. Specify a **Repository name** and be sure the repository is set to **public**.
. Click to view the `meta.yaml` file source.
. Edit the `meta.yaml` file in GitHub by clicking the **pencil** button.

+
. Edit the `meta.yaml` schema definition with the values below and commit to your `master` branch: (please take note of the values wrapped in curly braces. For instance, `{plugin_version}`` _should_ coincide with the VS Code extension you're porting. This will be important later.)

=== Visual Studio Code Extension
. Now we will download the `.vsix` Visual Studio Extension to your local filesystem. Navigate to the https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim[Microsoft Visual Studio Code Marketplace] to find the Vim extension and download it. *IMPORTANT: When downloading the extension be sure to rename it `vscode-vim.vsix`!*

. Once downloaded return to the root directory of your GitHub repository and click *Upload files*
+

+
. Now upload the `vscode-vim.vsix` plugin to the `mater` branch with a commit message.
+

+
. Now we will tag a release by clicking *releases* on our repository dashboard.
+

+
. Provide the appropriate version and release information on the *Release* page and click *Publish release*
+

+
. Lastly, copy the link to your tagged release of the `meta.yaml` file by clicking the *Version tag → meta.yaml → Raw* and copying the URL from the address bar.

Now we'll install the ported plugin to your workspace.

. Return to your isntance of CodeReady Workspaces Dashboard and select a workspaces.

. Navigate to the *Devfile* tab, locate the section labaled `components:` and add a new component (NOTE: be sure to replace `{plugin-repository}` with your tagged release path to the `meta.yaml` file you just coppied.):
