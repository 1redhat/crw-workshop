== Sharing your workspace with a co-worker
Code Ready Workspaces has a sharing feature that allows developers to share the code they are working on with others.  Its a bit like google docs for code.

We will continue to use the workspace we created in the previous lab to share it with others.

=== Sharing your workspace
. In the menu bar go to *File â†’ Share*.
. This brings you to settings page.  Click on the *Share* tab like below.

. Click the green *open* button in the upper right corner.
. Have the fellow student refresh thier browser.
. In the *RECENT WORKSPACES* they will have a new workspace with the same name as yours.

. Click on it.
. Now you and the fellow student open the *GreetingsService.java* file in the IDE.
. One of the students change code in the file.
. Notice the other one can see the changes in thier IDE.
