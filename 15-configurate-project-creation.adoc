== Configure Project Creation

In this lab you will learn how to customize the template for creating of a new project.
If you are the administrator, you may want to manage the cluster resource accordingly. A way to ensure that no project will consume all the resouces is by setting limit range and quota when creating a project.

=== Modify the project template

By default, there is no limits and quotas set when project was created.
Since OpenShift is a self-service platform, we are going to configure the project template. Once we added the default configuration to the project, project will be created with the specific configuration.

=== Steps

. Login in as `admin` via OC CLI
. Generate a default project template
+
[source, script]
----
 $ oc adm create-bootstrap-project-template -o yaml > template.yaml
----

. The template.yaml should be similar as shown below.
+
[source, yaml]
----
apiVersion: template.openshift.io/v1
kind: Template
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  name: project-request
objects:
- apiVersion: project.openshift.io/v1
  kind: Project
  metadata:
    annotations:
      openshift.io/description: ${PROJECT_DESCRIPTION}
      openshift.io/display-name: ${PROJECT_DISPLAYNAME}
      openshift.io/requester: ${PROJECT_REQUESTING_USER}
    creationTimestamp: null
    name: ${PROJECT_NAME}
  spec: {}
  status: {}
- apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
  kind: RoleBinding
  metadata:
    creationTimestamp: null
    name: admin
    namespace: ${PROJECT_NAME}
  roleRef:
    apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
    kind: ClusterRole
    name: admin
  subjects:
  - apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
    kind: User
    name: ${PROJECT_ADMIN_USER}
parameters:
- name: PROJECT_NAME
- name: PROJECT_DISPLAYNAME
- name: PROJECT_DESCRIPTION
- name: PROJECT_ADMIN_USER
- name: PROJECT_REQUESTING_USER
----

. Now having `ResourceQuota` and `LimitRange` objects ready. Objects are shown as below.
+
[source, yaml]
----
- apiVersion: v1
kind: "LimitRange"
metadata:
  name: project-limits
spec:
  limits:
    - type: "Container"
      default:
        cpu: "1"
        memory: "1Gi"
      defaultRequest:
        cpu: "500m"
        memory: "500Mi"
- apiVersion: v1
  kind: ResourceQuota
  metadata:
    name: project-quota
  spec:
    hard:
      pods: "10"
      requests.cpu: "4"
      requests.memory: 8Gi
      limits.cpu: "6"
      limits.memory: 16Gi
      requests.storage: "20G"
----

. Adding the above objects to the project template as shown below.
+
[source, yaml]
----
apiVersion: template.openshift.io/v1
kind: Template
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  name: project-request
objects:
- apiVersion: project.openshift.io/v1
  kind: Project
  metadata:
    annotations:
      openshift.io/description: ${PROJECT_DESCRIPTION}
      openshift.io/display-name: ${PROJECT_DISPLAYNAME}
      openshift.io/requester: ${PROJECT_REQUESTING_USER}
    creationTimestamp: null
    name: ${PROJECT_NAME}
  spec: {}
  status: {}
- apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
  kind: RoleBinding
  metadata:
    creationTimestamp: null
    name: admin
    namespace: ${PROJECT_NAME}
  roleRef:
    apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
    kind: ClusterRole
    name: admin
  subjects:
  - apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
    kind: User
    name: ${PROJECT_ADMIN_USER}
- apiVersion: v1
  kind: "LimitRange"
  metadata:
    name: ${PROJECT_NAME}-limits
  spec:
    limits:
      - type: "Container"
        default:
          cpu: "1"
          memory: "1Gi"
        defaultRequest:
          cpu: "500m"
          memory: "500Mi"
- apiVersion: v1
  kind: ResourceQuota
  metadata:
    name: ${PROJECT_NAME}-quota
  spec:
    hard:
      pods: "10"
      requests.cpu: "4"
      requests.memory: 8Gi
      limits.cpu: "6"
      limits.memory: 16Gi
      requests.storage: "20G"
parameters:
- name: PROJECT_NAME
- name: PROJECT_DISPLAYNAME
- name: PROJECT_DESCRIPTION
- name: PROJECT_ADMIN_USER
- name: PROJECT_REQUESTING_USER
----

. The project template must be created in openshift-config namespace. Load the template into the namespace.
+
[source, script]
----
$ oc create -f template.yaml -n openshift-config
template.template.openshift.io/project-request created
----

. Login to the Administrator Console as admin
. In the left panel, navigate to the *Administration → Cluster Settings*.
. Click `Global Configuration`
. Click `project` from the list
. Click `YAML` to edit the object
. Update the file with the following information to replace `spec: {}`
+
[source, yaml]
----
spec:
projectRequestTemplate:
  name: project-request
----

. Click save.

=== Confirm the changes

. Go the the Administrator Console
. In the left panel, navigate to the *Home → Project*.
. Click `Create Project`
. Enter `test-<UserName>` as project name
. You will get to the project Dashboard and scroll down to `Resource Quotas` sections.
. Click onto the resource quotas name next to the `RQ`

  image::project-template-rq.png[Resource Quota]

. Click YAML to see the details from the Resource Quota page.
. Object `ResourceQuotas` is automatically created at the project creation.
. In the left panel, navigate to the *Administration → Limit Ranges*.
. Object `LimitRange` is created as well.

The result is confirmed that the project template is configured.
